An agent skill that helps AI coding assistants like Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and Gemini write better SwiftData code. Covers `@Model`, `@Query`, predicates, indexes, migrations, relationships, iCloud sync, and more, targeting the mistakes LLMs actually make.

Also available:

- [SwiftUI Pro](https://github.com/twostraws/SwiftUI-Agent-Skill)
- [Swift Concurrency Pro](https://github.com/twostraws/Swift-Concurrency-Agent-Skill)
- [Swift Testing Pro](https://github.com/twostraws/Swift-Testing-Agent-Skill)

## Installing SwiftData Pro

You can install this skill into Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Cursor, and more by using `npx`:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/twostraws/swiftdata-agent-skill --skill swiftdata-pro
```

If you get the error `npx: command not found`, it means you don’t currently have Node installed. You need to run this command to install Node through Homebrew:

```bash
brew install node
```

And if *that* fails it usually means you need to [install Homebrew](https://brew.sh) first.

When using `npx`, you can select exactly which agents you want to use during the installation. You can also select whether the skill should be installed just for one project, or whether it should be made available for all your projects.

Alternatively, you can clone this whole repository and install it however you want.

If you're using Xcode, watch the YouTube video on [How to Install and Use Agent Skills in Xcode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKVZBKoB6P4) for a walkthrough.


## Using SwiftData Pro

The skill is called SwiftData Pro, and can be triggered in various ways. For example, in Claude Code you would use this:

> /swiftdata-pro

And in Codex you would use this:

> $swiftdata-pro

In both cases you can provide specific instructions if you want only a partial review. For example, `/swiftdata-pro Check my code for latest API usage` on Claude, or `$swiftdata-pro Check where indexes should be added to my SwiftData models` in Codex.

You can also trigger the skill using natural language:

> Use the SwiftData Pro skill to enable iCloud support in this project.


## Why Use an Agent Skill for SwiftData?

I wrote a [book on SwiftData](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftdata), and update it regularly as new features are added, so I’ve made it my business to understand the ins and outs of SwiftData.

This skill is the result of all that work. The rules contained here directly target common SwiftData mistakes made by LLMs, covering new features they aren’t trained on, older features they frequently make mistakes with, and patterns that help keep your code correct and efficient.

What this is *not* is just a dumping ground for all SwiftData advice ever. Agents already have a solid grounding of the fundamentals of SwiftData, so skills that do little more than reteach them what they already know are just burning tokens.

*This skill focuses on what actually has an impact.*


## Contributing

I welcome all contributions, whether that's adding new checks, improving existing checks, or editing this README – everyone is welcome!

- Keep your Markdown concise. There is a token cost to using skills, particularly with SKILL.md, so please respect the token budgets of users.
- Do not repeat things that LLMs already know, because it burns tokens for no benefit. Focus on edge cases, surprises, soft deprecations, and similar.
- All work must be licensed under the MIT license so it can benefit the most people.
